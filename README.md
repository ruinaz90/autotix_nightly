# AutoTix Nightly
Part of the AutoTix series to automate parts of nightly check-in for the fulfillment team.

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** Python, Qt

Written in Python, user interface designed using Qt.

## Optimizations
This was initially going to be an app that the user can run on the command line. A GUI was used instead to make it more user-friendly.

## Lessons Learned
The fulfillment team uses different computers each day and the team is not familiar with the command line. It was important to make the application easy to install and use on any device.
