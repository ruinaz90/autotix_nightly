# AutoTix Nightly
Part of the AutoTix series to automate parts of nightly check-in for the fulfillment team.

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** Python, Qt

Written in Python, user interface designed using Qt.

## Optimizations
This needed to be easy to install and use for the fulfillment team. It was initially going to be an app that the user can run on the command line. I added a GUI to make it more user-friendly instead.

## Lessons Learned
The fulfillment team uses different computers each day and the team is not familiar with the command line. It was important to make the application easy to use and accessible on any device.
